# YOLOv5 Object Detection for RarePlanes 

This repo contains three notebook tutorials in which you create a custom class using the RarePlanes data set, train a YOLOv5 model, perform inferences on the test set, and then evaluate performace. 

This ML pipeline uses a modified implementation of the YOLOv5 implementation found [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). The RarePlanes dataset can be found [here](https://www.cosmiqworks.org/rareplanes/) and helper functions for the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/aireveries/RarePlanes).
